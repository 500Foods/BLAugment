This is the official code repository for the [blaugment](https://www.blaugment.com) project.  This is a tool for collecting and managing blog information, with the main feature being the ability to augment blog posts with supplementary information.  Perhaps the original blog doesn't have a tagging system of its own. Or perhaps it would be useful to mark up individual posts with additional comments, scores, rankings, or flags of some kind, with the ability to organize and search across these additional elements. Supplemental data about each blog post can also be aggregated or generated, including word counts, word clouds, generated table of contents, and more. 

## Additional Background
This project came about as a result of writing a series of blog posts for TMS Software, with topics mostly focused on their TMS WEB Core and TMS XData products.  After writing 70+ blog posts, the limitations of their blog system were becoming readily apparent, but even more than that, how people were using the blog posts went beyond what is typically available in any blog system.  Users were interested in tagging and searching the content, naturally, but there was also a need for people to add their own tags and other notes relevant to them, and not necessarily relevant to anyone else.  There are various tools, like RSS readers, that offer interfaces to allow for managing this kind of thing with folders and even custom tags (something like NewsBlur for example), there's more that can be done with the content we're working with here.
